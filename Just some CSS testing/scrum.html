	<div id="content-1"><h2>What is Scrum?</h2>
	</br>
	<p>Scrum is a common tool for software development that cuts through complexity to focus on building a product that meets business needs. Management and teams are able to get their hands around the requirements and technologies and deliver a working product incrementally. </p>
	 </div>

<!--content-2 start-->
	<div id="content-2"><h2>Why is it called <q>Scrum</q>?</h2>
	</br>
	<p>Scrum was invented in the 90s, and the term was borrowed from rugby, where <q>scrum</q> (or <q>scrummage</q>) is a term that indicates the technique of restarting play and getting back in formation in an attempt to get the ball from the other team. Similarly, a sofware development team uses the same technique, by going through cycles again and again and incrementally developing a better product.</p>
	</div>

<div id="content-3"><h2>Roles within the Scrum Team</h2>
</br>
<p>The three roles in a scrum team are:</br>
<ul>
  <li>Product Owner</li>
  <li>Scrum Master</li>
  <li>Development Team</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<!--content-3 end-->

<!--content-4-->
<div id="content-4"><h3>The Product Owner</h3>
</br>
<p>The product owner represents the stakeholders and is the voice of the customer. He or she is accountable for ensuring that the team delivers value to the business. The product owner writes (or has the team write) customer-centric items (typically user stories), ranks and prioritizes them, and adds them to the product backlog. Scrum teams should have one product owner, this role should not be combined with that of the scrum master. The product owner should be on the business side of the project, and should never interfere or interact with team members on the technical aspects of the development task. This role is equivalent to the customer representative role in some other agile frameworks.</p>
</br></div>
<!--content-4 end-->

<!--content-5-->
<div id="content-5"><h3>The Scrum Master</h3>
</br>
<p>A scrum master is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables. The scrum master is not a traditional team lead or project manager, but acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences. The scrum master ensures that the scrum process is used as intended. The scrum master helps ensure the team follows the agreed scrum processes, often facilitates key sessions, and encourages the team to improve.</p>
</br></div>
<!--content-5 end-->

<!--content-6-->
<div id="content-6"><h3>The Development Team</h3>
</br>
<p>The development team is responsible for delivering potentially shippable increments of product at the end of each sprint. A team is made up of 3â€“9 individuals who do the actual work (analyse, design, develop, test, technical communication, document, etc.). Development teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product increment. The development team in scrum is self-organizing, even though there may be some level of interface with project management offices.</p></div>
